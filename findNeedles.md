## Getting Started <a name="Overview"/>

**findNeedles()** is a Java-based API called with two mandatory user input parameters:

- `String[] needles`: an array of **up to 5 elements**; referred to as *needles* or *needle*
- `String haystack`: a string of unrestricted length; referred to as *haystacks* or *haystack*

**findNeedles()** searches for *needles* in *haystack* and returns each *needle* with the number of times it occurred in *haystack*. 

> :memo: ***findNeedles() is case-sensitive and space-sensitive***
> <a name="case_sensitive"/>
> 
> Positive results are only returned if both the case of words and phrase spacing match exactly.

> :memo: ***Leaving a parameter blank***
> 
> If you do not input both parameters, the output will be null.

### findNeedles() example:<a name="Example"/>
	
	String haystack = "Heavy rain and heavy snow expected tomorrow.";
	String[] needles = {"Heavy", "rain", "snow", "expected", "Friday"};
	findNeedles(String haystack, String[] needles);
	
Returns:
	
	Heavy: 1
	rain: 1
	snow: 1 
	expected: 1
	Friday: 0
	
In this example, `Heavy` returns `1`, because it appears twice in *haystack* but only [once capitalized as in the *needle*](#case_sensitive). Both `rain` and `expected` return `1`, because they each appear once. `Friday` is returned as `0`, because it doesn't appear in *haystack*.

### findNeedles() error messages:<a name="Errors"/>

> ðŸš¨ ***"Too many words!" error message:***
> 
> The array within *String[] needles* can only take up to 5 elements. 

	String haystack = "Heavy rain and heavy snow expected tomorrow.";
	String[] needles = {"Heavy", "heavy", "rain", "snow", "expected", "Friday"};
	findNeedles(String haystack, String[] needles);
	
Returns:
	
	Too many words!

## Use case example<a name="Uses"/>

The following is an example of a **findNeedles()** use case:

- SEO keyword indexing:
	- Given a keyword list as *needles* and your files as *haystacks*, 
	you can iterate over the files and compare your list of *needles* using each 
	file (converted to a string) as a *haystack*. Each *needle* is counted and 
	you can see the frequency your targets use the list of keywords.
