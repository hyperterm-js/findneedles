## Getting Started <a name="Overview"/>

**findNeedles()** is a Java-based API called with two mandatory user inputs:

- `String[] needles`: an array of **up to 5 elements**; referred to as *needle* or *needles*
- `String haystack`: a string of unrestricted length; referred to as *haystack* or *haystacks*

**findNeedles()** searches for *needles* in *haystack* and returns each *needle* with the number of times it occurred in *haystack*. 

> :memo: ***findNeedles() is case-sensitive and space-sensitive***
> <a name="case_sensitive"/>
> 
> Positive results are only returned if both the case of words and phrase spacing match exactly between your *needle* and the *haystack*.

> :memo: ***Leaving a parameter blank returns null***
> 
> If you do not include values for the `String[] needles` and `String haystack` parameters, the output will be null.

### findNeedles() example:<a name="Example"/>
	
	String haystack = "Heavy rain and heavy snow expected tomorrow.";
	String[] needles = {"Heavy", "rain", "snow", "expected", "Friday"};
	findNeedles(String haystack, String[] needles);
	
Returns:
	
	Heavy: 1
	rain: 1
	snow: 1 
	expected: 1
	Friday: 0
	
In this example, `Heavy` returns `1`, because it appears twice in *haystack* but only [once capitalized as in the *needle*](#case_sensitive). Both `rain` and `expected` return `1`, because they each appear once. `Friday` is returned as `0`, because it doesn't appear in *haystack*.

> ðŸš¨ ***"Too many words!" error message:***

	String haystack = "Heavy rain and heavy snow expected tomorrow.";
	String[] needles = {"Heavy", "heavy", "rain", "snow", "expected", "Friday"};
	findNeedles(String haystack, String[] needles);
	
Returns:
	
	Too many words! 

In this example, `String[] needles` contains more than 5 elements.

## Use case examples<a name="Uses"/>

The following are examples of a **findNeedles()** use cases:

- SEO keyword counter:
	- Given a keyword list as *needles* and use your files as *haystacks*, 
	you can iterate over the files and compare your list of *needles* using each 
	file (converted to a string) as a *haystack*. Each *needle* is counted and 
	you can see the frequency your targets use the list of keywords.
	
- Terminology checker:
	- Sent chunks of your term list as *needles* to check for phrases in your files as *haystacks*.
	Some features may be causing users errors because of misaligned terminology. Having multiple 
	phases for the same actions like "open", "click", "double-click", and "select" may need alignment to help users navigate effectively.
	Iterate over the files and compare your list of *needles* using each file (converted to a string) as a *haystack*.
